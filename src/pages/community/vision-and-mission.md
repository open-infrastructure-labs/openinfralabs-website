# OpenInfra Labs Vision and Mission
                                                                     
This page is to help you understand the ovearching purpose (vision) of the OpenInfra Labs,, and how we're bringing about that vision, which is our mission.

## Vision of OpenInfra Labs

In support of the [Four Opens](https://openinfra.dev/four-opens/), OpenInfra Labs vision is the creation and sustainability of all-Open Infrastructure from myriad all-Open tools, platforms, and methods.
This Open Infrastructure enables the practice of Open Source software development and other [Open Work](https://fossrit.github.io/open-work-definition/) collaborations.

## Mission of OpenInfra Labs

In fulfilling the OpenInfra Labs vision, Laboratory projects work to define key concepts for establishing current and future Open Infrastructures.
These concepts include, but are not limited to, Open Cloud, Operate First, Open Data, Open Telemetry, Open Site/System Reliability Engineering (SRE), and so forth.

OpenInfra Labs projects then begin developing code and content around the concepts.
Projects work with a cloud-native development approach of discrete components that fit into all-Open Clouds.

### Old(?) mission

Delivering open source tools to run cloud, container, AI, machine learning and edge workloads efficiently, repeatedly and predictably
